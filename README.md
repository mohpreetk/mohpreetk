### About Me
I am a **Computer Programming** graduate from *Georgian College*.

I like creating new things and therefore think specific language does not matter. You will see projects with so many different languages in my profile because I keep learning and growing. I feel that programming languages are similar in so many way and different in so many other.\

I am passionate about **Code👩‍💻** and like to create with max accuracy and best practices.\

I am currently looking🔎 for an Entry level development job to launch my career in the industry.\
